# R5 Subscription Backport Proxy Server

Proxy server to support R5 Subscription Backport on EHR servers which do not implement Subscriptions. This server will proxy all requests, except for Subscriptions. On Subscriptions the server will begin polling the EHR and then send notifications back to the client when appropriate.

## Running the Server

The Subscription Proxy server is built on top of [Asymmetrik Node FHIR Sever](https://github.com/Asymmetrik/node-fhir-server-core). NodeJS and Yarn are required to run the app.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mcode/subscription-proxy.git
cd subscription-proxy
yarn install
yarn start
```

With default settings, the app will now be running at `http://localhost:8080`

The Backend Service Client can also be run using docker. Make sure you have docker installed and running, then build the image and run the client.

```./build-docker-image.bat
docker-compose up
```

The app will now be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Config

The default config can be found in `/config/default.js`. The important properties are:

```
fhirClientConfig.baseUrl: 'the actual EHR server full url'
fhirServerConfig.auth.resourceServer: 'this server URI'
fhirServerConfig.server.port: 'the port to run this server on'
fhirServerConfig.security.valueUri: 'SMART Backend Auth token uri'
```
